General Notes:

I chose to keep the Home link to the right, because I felt the menu and the contact us sections were more important, so I wanted those starting at the left. From my perspective, I would think people visiting a restaurant’s website would want to find the hours and menu before anything else.

I used different .js files for each page of the site because of the backstretch plugin, and since I used different photos for each page. I wasn’t sure how else to do it.

Extra Credit: 

Using an array to hold the order form information is probably not the best way, but my knowledge of this part of JS is limited. I used basic JS for the majority of the section, but .append and .remove were just so much easier with jQuery.

The form extra credit was definitely a challenge, and I had to do a lot of research to piece everything together. It was a learning experience, but I’m thinking there are easier ways to do it, because I think my code seems a little bloated. The hardest part was thinking through how I wanted the form to work, and then trying to make sense of the code I needed to accomplish it.

Another really tricky part of the form was that the order totals weren’t showing up to the hundredths place, and they were coming up as a string. I learned this new thing about parseFloat to learn how to turn the string back into a number and show the right number of decimal places.

Validator: 

The validator didn’t like the CSS of one of the plugins. I was nervous to go through and start making changes at this point.
